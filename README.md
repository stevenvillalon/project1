# Histograms & Hoops
During the Fall 2024 semester, I took courses in Probability & Statistics and Python programming. I wanted to come up with a project that would help me apply the concepts I was learning in both classes. In Statistics, we covered topics like histograms, probability distributions, and random variables. One day, while watching a basketball game with friends, I realized that the abundance of available basketball data would be a great resource to apply these techniques.

This app, built with Python and Streamlit, uses data from the NBA API, and focuses on box scores for all players in the 2024-2025 NBA season. It allows users to explore histograms of various player statistics and also estimate the probability of a player reaching a specific performance threshold, like scoring 30 points in a game.

I recently updated the app with 2 new improvements:
- The interface now allows for a side by side comparison of 2 players.
- Switched the histograms from static matplotlib plots to interactive plotly plots.
